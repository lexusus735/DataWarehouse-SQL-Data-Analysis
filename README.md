# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

A comprehensive end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution designed using modern best practices in data architecture, ETL, and business intelligence. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable and structured data pipeline using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) and perform advanced SQL-based analytical reporting.

> 🧠 Inspired by and developed following the tutorials from **CodeWithBaraa**.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture** for progressive data refinement:

### 🔸 Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

* **Source**: Raw CSV files
* **Target**: PostgreSQL tables (no transformation)

### 🔹 Silver Layer: Data Transformation

* Data cleaning, type casting, and derived columns
* Standardized and normalized structure

### 🟡 Gold Layer: Business-Ready Schema

* Star schema modeling (Fact + Dimension tables)
* Business views and analytical queries for decision-making

## 🔁 Project Components

### 1. Data Architecture

Modern Medallion design (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

### 2. ETL Pipelines

* SQL scripts to ingest, clean, and model data

### 3. Data Modeling

* Star Schema: `fact_sales`, `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `dim_date`

### 4. Analytics & Reporting

* SQL-driven business insights and KPIs

## 🧠 Example SQL Analysis

> 📌 **Replace these with your actual queries and charts later**

### ⏳ Time-Based Trends

```sql
-- Total Sales Over Time
SELECT order_date, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;
```

### 📈 Cumulative Metrics

```sql
-- Running Total of Sales
SELECT 
  order_date,
  SUM(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM fact_sales;
```

### 📉 Performance Insights

```sql
-- Current vs. Previous Year Sales
SELECT 
  year,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS current_year_sales,
  LAG(SUM(sales_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_sales
FROM (
  SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year, sales_amount
  FROM fact_sales
) sub
GROUP BY year;
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL installed
* SQL client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
* Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-warehouse-analytics.git
cd data-warehouse-analytics
```

### ⚙️ Setup

1. Load raw data into PostgreSQL using scripts in `sql/ingestion/`
2. Run transformation scripts in `sql/transformation/`
3. Build the star schema with `sql/modeling/`
4. Explore insights with queries in `sql/analysis/`

## 📊 Visualization (Optional)

> 📌 **Add your BI reports or screenshots here (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)**

* Sales Trend Dashboard 📉
* Customer Segmentation 📂
* Performance Scorecards 📋
